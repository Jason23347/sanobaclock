# README

This is a simple application build with Qt5 as a clock, <s>and for watching your wifus</s>.

## Install

### make

```bash
qmake
make
```

### start

```bash
./SanobaClock
```

Then the application will be open...maybe not.

You need to download asset package by yourself, from this site: http://sothewitch.imel.co.jp/android/2k92ytne/android_prepare.zip, there's also a nude dlc package but I won't give it to you ~.

Download the package and unpack to /your/root/,copy "config.ini" to the same path of the executable file, copy "mute.mp3" into the asset file.Then change the settings in config.ini.

If you started the application successfully, character will report time for you.

### settings

The settings are all in the config file "config.ini".

### todos

- add window to change config
- add alarm
